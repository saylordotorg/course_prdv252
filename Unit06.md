**Unit 6: Presenting Data with Charts** <span id="6"></span> 
*This unit will introduce charts, which are a very important feature in
Excel®. Charts help people to visual the data. Sometimes too much
information or lists of numbers cannot be compared or processed by our
brains efficiently. Charts help us humans to organize and visualize
information so we can grasp the concepts quicker. There are many
different types of charts. Which chart type to use will depend on the
information you are charting. For example, if you want to compare sales
totals from each branch office of a company, and that company had five
or six branches, then a pie chart would work perfectly. If the company
had 15 or 20 branches, that would be too many pie pieces, so a column
chart could be used. The reading will give you some good examples of
this concept. You will need to have the newer versions of Excel® to use
the file that accompanies this chapter. Charting and Chart Formatting
changed drastically from Excel® 2007 onward. If you have an older
version, you can still chart but you will need to use Help to learn
about the features in your version of Excel®.*

    of the many, many ways a chart can be formatted. I encourage you to
    explore as many formatting features on the three chart toolbars as
    you can. Use your Help feature to learn more about each feature if
    something gets confusing.
