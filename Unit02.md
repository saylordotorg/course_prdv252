**Unit 2: Formatting Spreadsheets** <span id="2"></span> 
*This unit will discuss formatting in more depth for cells, text,
numbers, including dates, and conditional formatting as well as the
worksheet tabs themselves. Formatting is often needed on spreadsheets
because it assists the reader to conceptualize numbers. It can be used
to highlight certain information that needs to be emphasized or create a
coherent organization for large pieces of data. This unit will deal with
many of the features and commands on the Home Ribbon.  
    
 Conditional Formatting will also be introduced. Conditional Formatting
is used to format text and numbers based on certain criteria or
conditions. This feature was greatly improved in the newer versions of
Excel®. If you have an older version or some other spreadsheet software,
this would be a good topic to investigate in the Help files of your
program.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 3 hours.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.1: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.2: 1 hour

**2.1 Using Help** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*Note: The first thing we will look at in this unit is Excel®’s Help
feature. Microsoft puts a lot of effort into creating useful Help files.
No matter what version of Excel® you are using, the Help directory that
comes with the program is quite large. With this much information
available, it is useful to become familiar with this tool.*

worksheets easier to manage. The videos within this link also discuss
moving, grouping and ungrouping, and rearranging worksheets within a
workbook as well as Freeze Panes for working within a large worksheet.
There is a lot of information here so take your time and practice these
skills in your own version of Excel®.*

**2.3 Conditional Formatting: Highlight Rules and Databars** <span
id="2.3"></span> 
*Conditional formatting is an easy way to format large pieces of data or
numbers to make important information stand out. This feature changed
quite a bit with the newer versions of Excel®: Excel® 2007 and 2010. If
you are using an older version of Excel®, you will not be able to use
most of the features that this subunit talks about, although you can
still conditionally format. You should explore the Help file in your
version of Excel® to find out how to conditionally format in your
version. It can be done, and you can probably find YouTube videos as
well. This subunit will show the examples in the newer versions which
have greatly expanded the availability of different types of conditional
formatting tools.*
