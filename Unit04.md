**Unit 4: Logical and Lookup Functions** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this unit we will be looking at Chapter 3 of the textbook, which
uses more advanced functions. As the chapter explains these functions,
go beyond the basic functions of Excel®. The IF function can be used in
many different instances that use numbers or text as the answer.
Remember that a comma separates the different parts of each function so
you should not type commas in large numbers. You should format the
numbers after the calculations have been made. We humans need to
separate numbers for easier reading, not the software program. You will
be nesting one function inside another. This will take some logical
thinking. Although you may not need to be a mathematician to master
Excel®, you do have to be able to logically set up formulas and
functions so the math can be done by the software. Linear or logical
thinking can be very helpful in this process. Again, it is recommended
that you not skip subunits in the Unit as each subunit builds the
spreadsheet for the next subunit.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 3 hours.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.1: 1.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.2: 1.5 hours

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   use Freeze Panes to lock rows and columns in place;
-   construct a logical test to evaluate the contents of a cell; and
-   create the IF, OR, AND, COUNTIF, AVERAGEIF(S), and SUMIF(S)
    functions.

**4.1 Logical Functions** <span id="4.1"></span> 
*The text explains that logical functions are used to assess the content
within cells and produce custom outputs, either text or numbers. When an
answer is text, you must put quotation marks both before and after the
word. This signifies to the software that the answer is a word, not a
mathematical computation. There is a lot of information in this subunit
so go slowly and reread any section that you need to. If you are doing
the work along with the text, and if anything does not match the answers
that the text gives, delete the formula and start again. A misplaced
comma or erroneous letter or number will make a formula wrong. I have
worked through each problem and if you do them as the book instructs you
should get a matching answer. Really pay attention to what you are
typing or clicking and have fun!*

     Instructions: Read Chapter 3: Logical and Lookup Functions through
    page 192 and then proceed to Section 3.1: Logical Functions, which
    starts on page 193. You will find the work-along Excel® file for
    this unit in the next resource box: *Excel® Text Chapter 3*.  
        
     Completing this assignment should take approximately 1.5 hours.

    3”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Excel-Text-Chapter-3.xls)  
      
     Instructions: This Excel® file is in the earlier version of Excel®,
    with the file extension .xls. If you have a newer version of Excel®,
    open it up and resave it in the current version of Excel® which has
    the file extension of .xlsx. If you have a newer version and leave
    it as an .xls you will see the text [Compatibility Mode] on the
    Title Bar. This will not affect the document at all. Again, the book
    will be showing the newer version in the pictures that accompany the
    text. As this chapter deals with formulas and functions, all Excel®
    programs write formulas in the same way and the Function dialog box
    is the same, so it doesn’t matter what version of Excel® you have
    for this unit. You will be completing the Investment Detail
    worksheet in this section.   
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 1 hour.

**4.2 Statistical IF Functions** <span id="4.2"></span> 
*This subunit will introduce the COUNTIF and COUNTIFS, the AVERAGEIF and
AVERAGEIFS, and the SUMIF and SUMIFS functions. These functions can be
confusing because they have nested criteria but, again, go slowly and
work through the logic. You will be completing the Portfolio Summary
worksheet from the spreadsheet you started in Subunit 4.1.*

     Instructions: Read Chapter 3, Section 3.2: Statistical IF
    Functions, which starts on page 231. You will continue to use the
    same spreadsheet that you started above in Unit 4.1 of this class
    (Excel® Text Chapter 3).  
        
     Completing this assignment should take approximately 1.5.
