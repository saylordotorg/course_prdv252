**Unit 7: More Work with Charts** <span id="7"></span> 
*To start this unit off we will take a look at a couple of videos from
the Goodwill Foundation’s Excel® 2010 series. We have used this video
series in previous units of this class, but now we will look at how they
build charts in Excel® 2010. Also, we will look at Sparklines – a new
feature in Excel® 2010. Sparklines are very small charts that can fit
into a cell, usually adjacent to the cell where the data are derived
from. The Sparkline graphically represents the number, and when used in
consecutive cells, can create a visual way to differentiate numerical
data for easier comprehension by the reader, without a large separate
chart either embedded on a page or separate from the data.*

     Instructions: Read through the six pages and watch the video on
    page 2. On page 4 they show you how to change a chart type after a
    chart has been created. This is something that was not shown before
    and can be useful when you want to compare charts and how your data
    will look before printing or sharing with others. If you have Excel®
    2010, open the Excel® practice spreadsheet and follow the directions
    on page 6 to practice what was demonstrated in the videos.  
        
     Completing this assignment should take approximately 30 minutes.
