This class is intended for students who have a basic understanding of
spreadsheets and are now ready to delve deeper into formatting, formulas
and functions, multi-page spreadsheets, charting data, creating tables
that have database features, and be introduced to pivot tables. This
class was designed to be an active, hands-on class. You will be creating
Excel® spreadsheets and have files to open and follow along as you
progress through the units. This class is not intended for a specific
occupation or activity, but when you are finished with this class, you
will be able to use Excel® in a variety of circumstances to format and
manipulate numerical data. Although the resources in this course use
Microsoft Excel® 2010, it should be noted that all of the skills and
tasks that you will be asked to complete can be done in any version of
Excel®. If you stay flexible enough in your thinking and search out the
commands and icons on whatever software you are using, you will succeed.

### Course Information

Welcome to PRDV252: Intermediate Excel®. General information on this
course and its requirements can be found below.  
    
 **Course Designer:** [Professor Chris
Wilkins](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-u-z/#ProfessorChrisWilkins)  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free and online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   [*How to Use Microsoft
    Excel®*](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/How%20to%20Use%20Microsoft%20Excel.pdf)
-   Goodwill Community Foundation’s *[Microsoft Excel®
    2010](http://www.gcflearnfree.org/excel2010)*

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to Units 3–5 as they are the heart of the software
and how to use Excel® to your mathematical advantage. You should also
complete and practice activities when presented at the end of some
units. This will help prepare you for the Final Exam. Note that you will
only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take approximately 30 hours to
complete. The 10 units are designed to take about 3 hours each.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** Open your own version of Excel® as you go along
and do the work that you are seeing. *Doing* is the fastest way to learn
any software program. Think of this class as a hands-on class and dig
into what you are learning and start exploring with whatever version of
Excel® you have access to. Each unit includes a *time advisory* that
lists the amount of time you should expect to spend on each subunit.
These should help you plan your time accordingly.
