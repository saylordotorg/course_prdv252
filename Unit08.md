**Unit 8: Graphics in Excel®** <span id="8"></span> 
*Although graphics are not necessarily needed in Excel® to get the point
across, it is sometimes good to use them to help the reader understand
the information. Just as charts help to explain complex data in a visual
format, graphics can point out or help to emphasize information that you
want the reader to easily grasp. This unit will look at many of the
features on the Insert ribbon in the Illustrations and Text groupings.
The only caveat I would put on this is that you should remember that you
are only using graphics to enhance the document. Too much visual
busyness will distract from the important information that is on the
spreadsheet. You will be learning all different types of graphics in
this unit, but only use a few on an actual business document.*
