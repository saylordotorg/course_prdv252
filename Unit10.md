**Unit 10: Tables** <span id="10"></span> 
*Tables are an important feature of Excel®. They are used to store large
pieces of data, usually on an ongoing basis. The data can then be sorted
and filtered to answer specific questions. Excel® tables have database
properties. Once a table has been created in Excel®, there are database
functions that can be used to do math on different categories within the
table. Pivot Tables and Charts will also be introduced. Once you have a
lot of data in one place, you can use Pivot Tables and Charts to
manipulate it to answer business questions.*

     Instructions: Click on the link to watch a video on creating
    tables. Once you have watched the video, try creating a table in
    your own Excel® program. Tables are an important feature of Excel®
    and something you should become comfortable using.  
        
     Completing this assignment should take approximately 15 minutes.

**10.1.2 Sorting Data** <span id="10.1.2"></span> 
*As you saw in the previous section, it is easy to sort and filter data
once the data are put into a table format. Let’s look a little closer at
ways to sort and filter data or lists. The techniques that you will
learn here can be used on a table or just a list of information you have
in Excel®.*

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read through the five pages and watch the video on
    page 2. If you have Excel® 2010, then download the practice workbook
    they provide on page 5 and try sorting the data as they showed in
    the lesson. You can also use the Data tab Sort commands as shown in
    the lesson to do advanced sorts on the table columns.  
        
     Completing this assignment should take approximately 20 minutes.

**10.1.3 Filtering Data** <span id="10.1.3"></span> 
*Filtering can be done on a data set or a table to give you control over
what information is shown on your spreadsheet. It allows you to narrow
down your data in different ways.*

    [“](http://www.gcflearnfree.org/excel2010/13)[Excel® 2010: Filtering
    Data](http://www.gcflearnfree.org/excel2010/13)[”](http://www.gcflearnfree.org/excel2010/13)
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read through the five pages and watch the four-minute
    video on page 2. Filtering can be used on just a list or on data
    that has been put into a table format. You’ll notice in the example
    that the column headings have names; this makes sorting and
    filtering much easier and is a good technique to use with data lists
    or tables. If you have Excel® 2010, download the practice workbook
    they provide on page 5 and follow the steps they give you to
    practice filtering. Note that you have to have done the reading, not
    just watched the video, to complete the filtering correctly because
    the reading differs from the video.  
        
     Completing this assignment should take approximately 20 minutes.

**10.2 Outlining Data** <span id="10.2"></span> 
*Outlining data helps to organize large pieces of information into
manageable chunks on screen. This can be done to lists of data,*
*NOTtables. You cannot create outlines or use the Subtotals command if
your data are still in a table format. This cannot be stressed enough.
If your data are still in a table format and you have access to the
Table Tools - Design toolbar, then you will not have access to Subtotals
and the outlining tools. You must click on your table and use the*
Convert to Range*command in the Tools grouping on the Table Tools -
Design toolbar. It is often a good idea to use a table to sort or filter
data the way you would like before you convert it to be subtotaled. You
may need to think about why you are subtotaling it and how the levels
should be grouped. This will make more sense after you have read through
the material. This idea of sorting then outlining may take some practice
but it is a good skill to master.*

-   **Reading: The Saylor Foundation’s “Convert to Range for
    Subtotaling”**

    Subtotaling”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/PRDV252-Unit-10.2-Convert-to-Range-for-Subtotaling-FINAL-UFinal.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the short explanation about converting a table
    to a list so that the Subtotal command can be utilized.  
        
     Reading this material should take approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: Read through the six pages and watch the video on
    page 2. If you have Excel® 2010, you can download the practice
    document they give you on page 6 and follow the directions to
    practice the skills you just learned.  
        
     Completing this assignment should take approximately 30 minutes.

**10.3 PivotTable and PivotChart** <span id="10.3"></span> 
*Now that you understand about tables, let’s talk about PivotTables,
sometimes called PivotTable Reports. If you have a large amount of data
that you can sort and filter, you may still want to be able to
manipulate it further to answer business questions or predict future
scenarios like sales or marketing events. PivotTables can help managers
answer or give a best-guess scenario.*

-   **Web Media: GCFLearnFree.org’s “Excel® 2010: Creating
    PivotTables”**
    Link: GCFLearnFree.org’s [“Excel® 2010: Creating
    PivotTables”](http://www.gcflearnfree.org/excel2010/20) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read through the seven pages and watch the two videos
    on page 2. If you have Excel® 2010, you can download the practice
    document and follow the directions on page 7 to practice creating a
    PivotTable and PivotChart. There is a lot of information here so go
    slowly and really practice these skills. Like charts, PivotTables
    changed a lot with Excel® 2007 and newer. If you are using an older
    version of Excel®, most of this information will be different and
    you will need to use your help feature to learn about PivotTables in
    your version of Excel®.  
        
     Completing this assignment should take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Watch the video. There is no practice document with
    this exercise, but you may want to create your own data to practice
    with or try opening another spreadsheet from an earlier lesson in
    the class and create a PivotTable and PivotChart for it. Employees
    with PivotTables and PivotCharts experience are seen as an asset in
    the office.  
        
     Completing this assignment should take approximately 30 minutes.

**Conclusion** <span id="10.4"></span> 
*Now that you have finished the class and are familiar with the Goodwill
Foundation’s LearnFree.org site, there are additional videos that you
may want to explore. The link to the main page is provided at the
beginning of this course in the Course Information section. Learning any
piece of software is like learning a foreign language, you have to use
it or you lose it. So, continue to practice and learn new things and
soon you will be comfortable working in Excel®.  
  
 When you are ready, proceed on to the final exam.*
